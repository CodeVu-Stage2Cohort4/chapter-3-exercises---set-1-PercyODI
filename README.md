# Chapter 3 Exercises

Write an application that does the following expressions. It should do all the expressions in this order.

1. Odd or Even
    - Given a number, decide if the number is odd or even
    - Input:
        - Take an integer as input. Assume that the input will be a valid integer
    - Output:
        - If integer is even, output "even"
        - If integer is odd, output "odd"
2. Divisible by 5 and 7
    - Given a number, write a boolean expression that checks whether the number is divisible by both 5 and 7, without a remainder
    - Input:
        - Take an integer as input. Assume that the input will be a valid integer
    - Output:
        - If number is divisible by both 5 and 7, output "True"
        - If number is not divisible by both 5 and 7, output "False"
3. Area of a trapezoid
    - Write an expression that calculates the area of a trapezoid by given sides a, b, and height h.
    - Input:
        - Read the value of side a, side b, and height h one at a time
        - Be sure to take them in that order: a, b, h
    - Ouput:
        - Print the area of the trapezoid as a number.
